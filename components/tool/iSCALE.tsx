                (Inferring Spatially resolved Cellular Architectures for
                Large-sized tissue Environments) is a novel framework designed
                to integrate multiple daughter captures and utilize H&E
                information from large tissue samples, enabling the prediction
                of gene expression in large-sized tissues with near single-cell
                resolution. This implementation is published at:{' '}
