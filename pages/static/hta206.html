    The Human Prostate Tumor Atlas Center will map the cellular and molecular
    architecture of prostate cancer, particularly focusing on African American
    men, who are disproportionately affected by aggressive forms of the disease.
    Using advanced spatial and molecular profiling techniques, this project will
    generate a high-resolution atlas to understand tumor dynamics, treatment
    resistance, and health disparities. The findings will help improve early
    diagnosis and treatment strategies, especially for underserved populations.
