    This project focuses on creating a 3D atlas of pancreatic cancer
    development, particularly in individuals with genetic mutations that
    increase cancer risk. By mapping the progression of pre-cancerous lesions to
    invasive cancer, the researchers aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms
    behind early cancer development. The atlas will provide critical insights
    for early detection and intervention strategies, potentially improving
    outcomes for high-risk individuals.
