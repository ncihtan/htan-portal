    This project aims to understand how high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)
    metastasizes and develops resistance to chemotherapy, focusing on late-stage
    diagnosis. A 3D cancer atlas will be created using molecular and cellular
    profiling to map tumor progression in patients. The data will help identify
    key molecular changes responsible for resistance and could lead to more
    effective treatments and improved survival rates. The multi-disciplinary
    team will integrate various technologies to produce a comprehensive spatial
    map of ovarian cancer.
