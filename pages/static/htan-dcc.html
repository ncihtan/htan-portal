<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Data Coordinating Center</h3>

<p>
    The HTAN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) proudly supports each of the HTAN
    atlas teams and pilot programs as well as the broader Network by
    coordinating Network activities; providing centralized resources for data
    and resource storage and access within HTAN as well as dissemination to the
    wider scientific community; developing powerful data analysis and
    visualization tools to enable researchers to make novel discoveries using
    HTAN data; and conducting outreach to the community. Within HTAN, the DCC
    also leads various efforts to develop an extensible data model as well as
    clinical data and metadata standards that will ensure the accessibility and
    interoperability of HTAN data with the wider cancer research data ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
    Comprised of individuals from four institutions, the DCC team brings to HTAN
    extensive experience participating in major research consortia, including
    TCGA, AACR Project GENIE, and the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium, as well
    as leading open-source software development projects such as cBioPortal for
    Cancer Genomics, Synapse, and the ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) and
    community engagement projects such as DREAM Challenges. The DCC team draws
    upon this collective experience and deep technical expertise in biomedical
    science and data science to support the goals of HTAN and to promote a
    collaborative research and discovery environment within HTAN and the wider
    cancer research community.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>ETHAN CERAMI, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />
    Dr. Ethan Cerami is Director of the Knowledge Systems Group and Principal
    Scientist in the Department of Data Sciences at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
    (DFCI). He has an M.S. in Computer Science from New York University and a
    Ph.D. in Computational Biology from Cornell University. Prior to joining
    Dana-Farber, Dr. Cerami was Director of Computational Biology at Blueprint
    Medicines and Director of Cancer Informatics Development at Memorial Sloan
    Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). While at MSKCC, Dr. Cerami co-founded the
    cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, and his current group at DFCI remains active
    in its continued development while also being central contributors to other
    major consortium efforts such as the NCI-funded Cancer Immunologic Data
    Commons and AACR Project GENIE.

<h3>ADAM TAYLOR, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/adam_taylor_portrait.png" />
    Dr. Adam Taylor is the Director of Cancer Biology at Sage Bionetworks,  
    where he leads a team of data and community managers, along with  
    bioinformatics engineers, working on cancer biology efforts like AACR  
    Project GENIE and the MC2 Center. He holds an MEng in Biochemical  
    Engineering from the University of Bath and a Ph.D. in Pharmacy from the  
    University of Nottingham. Before joining Sage, Adam was a postdoctoral  
    fellow at the University of Washington and later a Senior Scientist at the  
    National Physical Laboratory, where he led work advancing mass spectrometry  
    imaging to track cancer metabolism as part of the Cancer Grand Challenges  
    Rosetta Team. His interests include developing effective data-sharing  
    mechanisms for multiplexed tissue imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and  
    digital pathology, with a focus on data quality and AI-readiness.

<h3>NIKOLAUS SCHULTZ, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/schultz_181106_18_1200x800-e1560974759288.webp" />
    Dr. Niki Schultz is Associate Attending in the Computational Oncology
    Service of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Affiliate
    Member of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan
    Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). As head of the Knowledge Systems Group in
    the Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology, he leads
    development of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, a web-based resource for
    analysis of complex cancer genomics data, and of OncoKB, a precision
    oncology knowledge base. His research focuses on identifying the genomic
    alterations that underlie cancer, their mechanisms of action, and novel
    therapeutic approaches. Dr. Schultz has made significant contributions to
    several projects of TCGA and AACR Project GENIE, and he is an investigator
    in the Stand Up to Cancer Prostate Cancer Dream Team. He has a particular
    interest in enabling discoveries by developing novel computational methods
    and databases that help bridge the divide between computer scientists on one
    side and clinicians and researchers on the other.

    Dr. Vésteinn Thorsson is a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for
    Systems Biology. His research encompasses cancer genomics and
    immuno-oncology, and he has extensive experience working with data analysis
    and data coordination in collaborative cancer genomics projects. As part of
    The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, Dr. Thorsson contributed
    substantially to published studies on gastrointestinal tumors, including
    serving as both Data and Analysis Coordinator and playing a key role in
    determining gastric molecular subtypes. Dr. Thorsson also served as Co-Chair
    of a working group that recently completed a comprehensive analysis of all
    TCGA gastrointestinal tumor samples and of a working group dedicated to
    characterizing immune response in the more than 10,000 TCGA tumor samples.
    In addition, he serves as a project lead for the CRI iAtlas project
    (cri-iatlas.org), an interactive web resource for immuno-oncology research.
