    This project aims to create a 3D atlas of colorectal cancer to investigate
    differences between early-onset and late-onset cases of the disease. By
    analyzing the spatial organization of tumors and surrounding tissues, the
    research will reveal how interactions between cancer cells, microbes, and
    the immune system contribute to cancer progression. The findings could lead
    to new strategies for early detection and targeted treatments, particularly
    for younger patients who face increasing rates of colorectal cancer.
