    This project will build a multidimensional atlas of multiple myeloma,
    focusing on the early stages of the disease when precancerous cells begin to
    evolve into malignant forms. By mapping the genetic, molecular, and spatial
    characteristics of these early changes, the research aims to identify
    targets for early intervention. This work could improve early diagnosis and
    lead to therapies that prevent the progression of multiple myeloma in
    high-risk individuals.
