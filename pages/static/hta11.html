<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

<h3>COLON MAP: Colon Molecular Atlas Project</h3>
<p>
    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in
    global incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from
    pre-cancerous adenomas. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive
    strategies and risk stratification models to decrease incidence, improve
    early detection, and prevent deaths from CRC.
</p>
<p>
    We believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision
    diagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell
    analysis. As such, we will map spatial relationships across the spectrum of
    normal colon, early polyps, and late adenomas, including their unique
    stromal and microbial microenvironments to identify unique molecular
    phenotypes.
</p>
<p>
    Our goal will be accomplished through prospective, standardized collection
    and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens, and related
    clinical and epidemiological data from participants undergoing colonoscopy
    or surgical resection. The biospecimens from these participants will be used
    for single-cell RNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiplex
    immunofluorescence, species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ
    hybridization, and other approaches. Finally, the information from these
    approaches will be integrated to develop a single-cell pre-cancer atlas with
    defined molecular phenotypes for dissemination to the broader scientific
    community.

<h2>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</h2>

<h3>ROBERT COFFEY, M.D.</h3>
<img src="/rcoffey.webp" />
<p>
    Dr. Robert Coffey is John B. Wallace Professor of Medicine, Professor in the
    Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, and an Ingram Professor of
    Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He directs the
    Vanderbilt Epithelial Biology Center and is principal investigator of
    Vanderbilt’s NCI-funded GI Specialized Programs of Research Excellence
    (SPORE), which focuses on colorectal cancer. He recently received an NCI
    Outstanding Investigator Award. His basic research focuses on the spatial
    compartmentalization of the EGF receptor (EGFR), its cognate ligands, and
    relevant signaling molecules in the context of polarized epithelial cells
    and how their dysregulation contributes to cancer. His lab identified a new
    mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes, and he was a principal
    investigator within the U19 Common Fund initiative to understand the
    biogenesis and function of exosome-associated secreted RNAs. Other prior
    studies led by Dr. Coffey found that a pan-ERBB negative regulator, LRIG1,
    marks colonic stem cells and acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo. As part of
    a Common Fund NCI partnership grant with GE Healthcare, his lab also helped
    develop the optimized multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) platform used in
    this project.

<h3>KEN LAU, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    Dr. Ken Lau earned his B.S. degree and his Ph.D. in Proteomics and
    Bioinformatics from the University of Toronto. After a joint postdoctoral
    fellowship at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital, he joined the faculty
    at Vanderbilt as an Assistant Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology in
    2013. Dr. Lau is an active member of the Vanderbilt Epithelial Biology
    Center and is currently an Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental
    Biology. Dr. Lau’s research revolves around how different cell populations
    in the gut integrate into tissue function with a specific focus on the gut’s
    role in microbial sensing and stem cells in colorectal cancer. His lab
    applies systems biology tools to understand tissue ecosystems as cell
    networks, spanning the realms of both experimental and computational
    biology. Dr. Lau has made various contributions to single-cell technologies,
    including multiplex microscopy, mass cytometry, and single-cell
    transcriptomics.

<h3>MARTHA J. SHRUBSOLE, Ph.D.</h3>
<img src="/mshrubsole.webp" />
<p>
    Dr. Martha Shrubsole is Research Professor of Medicine at Vanderbilt
    University Medical Center where she leads a research portfolio of molecular,
    nutritional, and interventional epidemiology. A major focus of Dr.
    Shrubsole’s research is to understand the etiology of gastrointestinal
    neoplasia. She seeks to identify and evaluate modifiable factors,
    biomarkers, and molecular mechanisms for the prevention, early detection,
    and precision-based interception of cancer and its precursor lesions with
    emphasis on sessile serrated polyps and conventional colorectal adenomas.
    Some of these areas of study include nutrients such as one-carbon
    metabolism, inflammatory markers, gut microbiome, molecular landscape of
    colorectal polyps, health disparities, and predictors of metachronous
    adenomas. In addition, Dr. Shrubsole has had leading roles in multiple
    randomized trials and large-scale epidemiologic studies based in the United
    States and globally.
