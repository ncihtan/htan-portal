    This project focuses on creating a spatial atlas of low-grade gliomas to
    understand how they progress to more aggressive forms of cancer. By
    comparing tumors that remain indolent with those that become malignant, the
    team aims to identify early molecular and cellular changes that predict this
    progression. Advanced imaging and molecular techniques will be used to map
    these changes, providing insights into potential therapeutic interventions
    to prevent malignancy.
