<h3>Joan S. Brugge, PhD - Devising new strategies to track and prevent breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
The overall goal of this project is to better understand the earliest stages of
BRCA cancer development, in order to design strategies to prevent its
progression to frank cancer. 
</p>

<h3>Leif W. Ellisen, MD, PhD - Dissecting early pathogenesis of BRCA1/2-associated cancer for risk prediction and prevention</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
	The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain better molecular knowledge of
	early lesions in order to improve prediction, early detection and cancer
	prevention for BRCA mutation carriers
</p>

<h3>Lewis C. Cantley, PhD - Identification and Targeting of Post-Translationally Modified Neoantigens Presented in BRCA Mutant Tumors</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
The goal of this proposal is to better understand the immune status of BRCA
tumors in order to target them using a cancer vaccine (or other immunotherapy
approaches). 
</p>

<h3>Charis Eng, MD, PhD - Interplay and perturbations of the local microbiome and host immune system in breast cancer</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand how microbes and the immune system interact and how this affects the development of BRCA breast cancers.
</p>

<h3>Victor Velculescu, MD, PhD - Early detection of cancer in high-risk BRCA mutation carriers using liquid biopsies</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
	The goal of this project is to develop a sensitive blood test that will allow the detection of early BRCA cancers.
</p>

<h3>Katherine L. Nathanson, MD - Determinants of immune activity and molecular features in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
This project aims at creating a biorepository that will allow a better understanding of the interplay between molecular features and immunogenicity in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, which represents critical information in the design of novel therapies.
</p>

<h3>Patrick Sung, PhD - Dissection of BRCA-mediated Tumor Suppression Pathways</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
	The goal of this project is to better understand how BRCA-mediated defects in DNA repair mechanisms give rise to cancer and later to resistance to standard therapy.
</p>

<h3>Ronny Drapkin, MD, PhD &amp; Charles Drescher, MD -  Generating and incorporating ovarian cancer data to Gray Foundation pre-cancer BRCA Atlas</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
	The overall goal of this proposal is to generate genomic, transcriptomic, and imaging data on early BRCA ovarian lesions to be incorporated into the Gray BRCA Precancer Atlas.
