<h2>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</h2>

<h3>LI DING, Ph.D.</h3>
<img src="/lding.webp" />
<p>
    Dr. Li Ding’s current research focuses on the discovery of genetic changes
    (somatic and germline) contributing to human diseases by integrating various
    data types, including DNA, RNA, and proteomics data. Her research team has
    developed a collection of widely-used computational tools, including
    VarScan, SomaticSniper, SciClone, BreakDancer, BreakFusion, MSIsensor,
    Pindel-C, GenomeVIP, HotSpot3D, PathScan, and MuSiC. Dr. Ding plays
    significant roles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International
    Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis
    Consortium (CPTAC). She co-chairs the TCGA PanCanAtlas Oncogenic Process
    Group, the TCGA Sarcoma Analysis Working Group, and the ICGC Mutation
    Calling Group. Dr. Ding also serves on the Steering Committees of the
    Genomic Data Commons (GDC), CPTAC, and TCGA. Dr. Ding has successfully led
    many large-scale, multi-institute studies on the genomics of lung
    adenocarcinomas, AML, and breast cancer. Building on this foundation, her
    team has produced a series of seminal publications in the fields of cancer
    genomics research and cancer biology.

<p>
    Dr. Ryan Fields’ clinical expertise includes pancreatic, liver, bile duct,
    stomach and small intestine cancer; melanoma and other skin cancers; and
    sarcoma. His research interests include care of patients with tumors of the
    pancreas, liver (primary and metastatic), bile ducts, stomach, and small
    intestine, as well as patients with melanoma and other skin cancers and
    sarcomas. Dr. Fields’ research focuses on the identification and treatment
    of patients at high risk for recurrence of their cancer and the use of novel
    treatment modalities to improve survival.

<h3>WILLIAM GILLANDERS, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    Dr. William Gillanders’ clinical expertise includes breast cancer and
    surgical endocrinology, including minimally invasive endocrine surgery. His
    research interests include the molecular detection of breast cancer in
    sentinel lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow as well as
    antigen-specific T cell responses to cancer vaccines.

<h3>SAMUEL ACHILEFU, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    Our research interests are in the design, development, and biochemical
    evaluation of molecular imaging agents and drugs in cells and living
    organisms. Through highly multidisciplinary research, we also develop new
    imaging systems for clinical applications. Our most recent accomplishments
    include the discovery of a broad spectrum cancer imaging agent, a portable
    goggle device for image-guided surgery, a depth-independent photo
    therapeutic platform for treating diseases and a reporter molecular system
    for reporting kinase activities. The ultimate goal is to validate new
    research concepts in the lab and translate them to humans.
