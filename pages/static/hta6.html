<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<h3>Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas</h3>
<p>
    The Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center is designed to construct an atlas that
    can be used to better understand ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a
    preinvasive breast cancer precursor. DCIS is an extremely common clinical
    diagnosis that is essentially a disease of screening triggered by the
    detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the
    advent of mammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon
    finding. Over 60,000 women in the United States will be presented with this
    diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for disease
    management, which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy.
    We propose to compile multi-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS
    to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to better understand the
    disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful
    translational endpoint.
</p>
<p>
    To do this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and
    complementary clinical, experimental, and quantitative expertise and
    experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these
    studies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it
    pertains to precancer development and progression. Specific aspects of the
    proposed atlas construction include: 1) several types of DCIS cohorts that
    will capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective
    clinical trial cohort undergoing active surveillance; 2) analyses designed
    to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary
    and atlas building considerations based on 3)
    radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches; 4)
    characterization at multiple scales including whole-tumor, single-duct, and
    single-cell levels; 5) characterization of relevant parameters including
    mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and
    microenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles; 6)
    incorporation of the breast cancer-intrinsic subtype paradigm into the
    analytic phase; and 7) layered, spatial, and longitudinal data
    visualization. Overall, this work will provide a comprehensive platform to
    guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other precancers.

<h2>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</h2>

<h3>E. SHELLEY HWANG, M.D., M.P.H.</h3>
<img src="/shwang.webp" />
<p>
    Dr. E. Shelley Hwang is the Mary and Deryl Hart Professor of Surgery at Duke
    University School of Medicine and Chief of Breast Surgery for the Duke
    Cancer Institute, an NIH-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her
    research interests have spanned a broad range of projects in translational
    research that seek to elaborate biomarkers in the tumor, the
    microenvironment, and blood. Dr. Hwang is a surgeon-scientist and
    experienced clinical trial investigator with an over 15-year interest in
    both the biology and treatment of early-stage breast cancer. She also is the
    PI of a national cooperative group study through the ALLIANCE, known as the
    COMET study, which evaluates the role of active surveillance compared to
    usual care for DCIS.

<h3>ROB WEST, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    Dr. Rob West is a Professor of Pathology at Stanford University Medical
    Center. He is a clinician scientist with experience in translational
    genomics research to identify new prognostic and therapeutic markers in
    cancer. His research focus is on the progression of neoplasia to invasive
    carcinoma. His lab has developed spatially oriented in situ methods to study
    archival specimens. In addition to running a research laboratory, Dr. West
    also serves as a surgical pathologist specializing in breast pathology at
    Stanford University Hospital.

<h3>CARLO MALEY, Ph.D., M.Sc.</h3>

<p>
    Dr. Carlo Maley is Associate Professor of the Biodesign Institute at the
    Arizona State University School of Life Sciences. He is a cancer biologist,
    evolutionary biologist, and computational biologist working at the
    intersection of those fields. His team applies evolutionary and ecological
    theory to three problems in cancer: (1) neoplastic progression: the
    evolutionary dynamics among cells of a tumor that drive progression from
    normal tissue to malignant cancers; (2) acquired therapeutic resistance: the
    evolutionary dynamics by which our therapies select for resistance and we
    fail to cure cancer; and (3) the evolution of cancer suppression mechanisms
    in large, long-lived animals like elephants and whales (a problem called
    Peto’s Paradox). Dr. Maley’s lab uses genomic data mining, phylogenetics,
    computational modeling, as well as wet lab techniques to solve these
    problems. In all of this work, their goals are to develop better methods to
    prevent cancer and improve cancer management.
