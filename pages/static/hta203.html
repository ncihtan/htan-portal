    This center aims to map the progression of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer
    (HDGC), focusing on the transition from early pre-cancerous lesions to
    advanced gastric cancer. Using advanced 2D and 3D spatial techniques, the
    research will track cellular and molecular changes in patients with CDH1
    mutations to identify early markers of cancer development. The findings will
    guide more personalized approaches to cancer prevention and treatment,
    potentially reducing the need for invasive surgeries like prophylactic
    gastrectomies.
