    The second data release of HTAN public data is now available on the HTAN
    Data Portal. This v2.0 release includes new data from several HTAN atlases:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        192 cases with new imaging data of which 86 have MIBI data, 105 t-CyCIF,
        and 1 both CyCIF and mIHC. This means people can now browse and view
        over 500 images in Minerva.
    </li>

    <li>
        100 cases with new scRNASeq data of which 62 have level 3 and higher
        available for download, allowing for download and analysis of scRNASeq
        data from over 150 cases and 250 biospecimens.
    </li>

    <li>
        1 case with both bulk DNASeq and RNASeq, which can now be explored in
        cBioPortal as well as downloaded from the data portal.
    </li>
</ul>
