    This atlas will explore the unique tumor microenvironment of pediatric solid tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma, to uncover how these environments influence treatment resistance and cancer progression. By studying tumors at different stages, the team hopes to discover how cells within the microenvironment interact to promote cancer growth. This research aims to find new therapeutic targets to improve treatment and survival outcomes for children with solid tumors.
