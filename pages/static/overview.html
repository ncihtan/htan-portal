        Launched in September of 2018, the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) is a
        National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Cancer Moonshot<sup>SM</sup>
        initiative through which a collaborative network of Research Centers and a
        central Data Coordinating Center are constructing 3-dimensional atlases of
        the cellular, morphological, and molecular features of human cancers as they
        evolve from precancerous lesions to advanced disease. Across a diverse set
        of cancer types, these atlases aim to define critical processes and events
        throughout the life cycle of human cancers, such as the transition of
        pre-malignant lesions to malignant tumors, the progression of malignant
        tumors to metastatic cancer, tumor response to therapeutics, and the
        development of therapeutic resistance. The diverse set of cancer types under
        investigation include tumors that affect minority and underserved
        populations, tumors with a hereditary component, and highly aggressive
        pediatric cancers.

        Within HTAN, ten Research Centers are working to identify the molecular and
        cellular conditions that cause healthy cells to become cancerous and that
        drive critical transitions in advanced cancers. Two atlas pilot projects –
        one Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP) and one Human Tumor Atlas Pilot
        Project (HTAPP) – were funded previously by NCI and also are contributing
        data and resources to the Network. A single HTAN Data Coordinating Center
        (DCC) supports each of the atlas teams and the broader Network by
        coordinating Network activities, providing centralized resources for data
        and resource storage, access, and sharing, and conducting outreach to the
        community.
