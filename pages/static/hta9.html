<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

<h3>Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas</h3>
<p>
    The overall goal of the HTAN OMS Atlas Center is to elucidate mechanisms by
    which metastatic breast cancers become resistant to current generation
    pathway- and immune checkpoint-targeted treatments. The OMS Atlas is
    motivated by the appreciation that these treatments are often effective in
    primary tumors but only transiently effective in the metastatic setting.
    Possible resistance mechanisms include tumor-intrinsic genomic instability
    and epigenomic plasticity, as well as events extrinsic to the cancer cells,
    including chemical and mechanical signals from the microenvironments,
    production of mechanical extracellular matrix barriers and/or changes in
    vasculature that reduce drug and/or immune cell access, nanoscale cancer
    cell-microenvironment interactions that reduce drug efficacy, and a plethora
    of immune resistance mechanisms, such as loss of HLA expression and antigen
    presentation, and immune exhaustion. These mechanisms likely vary between
    patients and within individual patients and change with time as tumors
    respond to therapeutic attack. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating
    resistance mechanisms in two specific current generation clinical trial
    scenarios: (a) hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing
    treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy and
    (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP
    inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.

<h2>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</h2>

<h3>JOE GRAY, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    Dr. Joe W. Gray, a physicist and engineer by training, is the Director of
    the Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine and Associate Director for
    Biophysical Oncology at the Knight Cancer Institute, both at Oregon Health &
    Science University. Dr. Gray’s research program uses integrated omic
    analysis and multiscale imaging to identify drug resistance mechanisms that
    are intrinsic to the tumor or that derive from tumor-microenvironment
    interactions. He has contributed to development of a number of important
    analytical tools including high-speed chromosome sorting, BrdUrd/DNA
    analysis of cell proliferation, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization,
    Comparative Genomic Hybridization and End Sequence Profiling. Currently, he
    is applying omic and multiscale image analysis approaches to identify
    mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and vulnerability in metastatic breast
    cancer. He is author of more 500 publications and holds 80 US patents.

<p>
    Dr. Gordon B. Mills earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in biochemistry and completed
    his training in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Alberta.
    Prior to moving to the Knight Cancer Institute, Dr. Mills was at the MD
    Anderson Cancer Center, the number one ranked cancer center in the United
    States. At the Knight Cancer Institute at the Oregon Health & Science
    University, Dr. Mills is Director of Precision Oncology and SMMART trials.
    He is responsible for the implementation of an integrated program of tumor
    analysis, decision-making, and implementation of novel precision oncology
    trials. Dr. Mills is recognized as one of the most highly quoted scientists
    in the world with over 1,000 publications, and he also holds more than 20
    patents.

<p>
    Dr. George V. Thomas is Professor of Pathology at Oregon Health & Science
    University. He is a member of the Knight Cancer Institute, Director of the
    Histopathology Shared Resource, and Associate Medical Director of the Knight
    Diagnostic Laboratories. Dr. Thomas completed his pathology residency and
    fellowships in the Harvard and UCLA medical systems and was on the faculty
    at UCLA prior to joining OHSU. As a specialist in genitourinary cancers, he
    has served as an invited member of the Mouse Models of Human Cancer
    Consortium, Stand Up 2 Cancer Prostate Dream Team, Mechanisms of Cancer
    Therapeutics study section, TGCA Papillary Kidney Cancer Analysis Working
    Group, and the TCGA Pan-Cancer Metabolism Working Group. Clinically, he has
    leveraged his molecular insights to lead the molecular diagnostics efforts
    that guide the precision oncology program at the Knight Cancer Institute.

<h3>JEREMY GOECKS, Ph.D.</h3>
<img src="/jgoecks.webp" />
<p>
    Dr. Jeremy Goecks is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and
    Computational Biology at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). His
    research program develops computational tools and infrastructure for
    analysis of large biomedical datasets. At the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute,
    Dr. Goecks leads the development of computational methods for precision
    oncology that integrate clinical, imaging, and omics data to (1) predict
    tumor response to targeted therapies and (2) identify tumor cellular
    pathways associated with adaptation and susceptibility to therapies. He has
    leadership positions in several national and international computational
    biomedical infrastructure projects funded by NCI, NHGRI, and NSF. He also is
    a lead investigator for the Galaxy Project (http://galaxyproject.org), a
    web-based computational workbench used by thousands of scientists throughout
    the world.
