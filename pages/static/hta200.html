    This project aims to develop an atlas that maps the early phases of skin
    cancer, focusing on the transition from pre-cancerous lesions to melanoma
    and squamous cell carcinoma. The research will integrate genetic and
    immunological data to understand how the immune system interacts with tumors
    during these early stages. The goal is to identify biomarkers and
    therapeutic targets that could improve early diagnosis and treatment of skin
    cancers, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.
