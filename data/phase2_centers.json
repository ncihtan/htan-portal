    "description": "Our PCA research center brings together the UCLA Neurosurgery team with the Caltech spatial single cell team to construct a comparative spatial atlas of low-grade gliomas. The collaboration between the three components of the PCA research center has already generated preliminary data in several glioma samples. We will expand this effort to generate a comparative atlas of gliomas with distinct progression outcomes using integrated spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and chromosome profiling. By comparing the low-grade gliomas that eventually transform with ones that stay indolent or do not recur, and with IDH-mutant high-grade gliomas, we aim to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms at the low-grade stage that are predictive of malignant transformation (MT) and to suggest intervention strategies to prevent MT. The comparative analysis will examine three types of changes in low-grade gliomas with different outcomes: cell type composition, tumor microenvironment, and pathway specific gene expression. From UCLA’s Brain Tumor Translation Resource (BTTR) center, we have already collected 99 fresh-frozen low-grade glioma samples and will collect approximately an additional 100 samples of low-grade glioma with different outcomes (MT, indolent, and no- recurrence). 38% of the current cohort of patients are from under-represented minority groups; we will continue to recruit from a diverse patient pool in order to better understand which patients may be at higher risk for malignant transformation and therefore need more frequent surveillance or earlier intervention. We will then generate an integrated multi-modal spatial atlas targeting 2500 mRNAs, 10 proteins and 10 DNA CNVs and translocations. From the high sensitivity and multiplexed RNA seqFISH assays, we will be able to capture not only cell type and microenvironment information, but also genes and pathways that could be causal for progression to malignancy. Lastly, we will use the data to 1) predict tumor progression based on the cell type compositions and microenvironments; 2) design intervention strategies based on the spatial data, using counterfactual inference models to affect immune infiltrating and other predictors of progression; and 3) build a model of tumor progression dynamics based on gene expression and mechanics of the tissue. Our comprehensive low-grade glioma tissue collection, the integrated spatial dataset with transcriptomics, proteomics and chromosomal abnormalities, and the models built using advanced machine-learning tools will extend the existing capabilities of the HTAN consortium and be interoperable. The atlas and the computational tools will be used by us and the wider scientific community to further understand the mechanisms leading to malignant transformation."

    "description": "The majority of solid tumors in children have a unique origin compared to those in adults, stemming from their rise from embryonic cells. Despite this distinction, there is still limited understanding of the differences in the microenvironments of these pediatric tumors compared to adult cancers, and how these differences might contribute to lineage plasticity and treatment resistance. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive investigation into the spatial biology of these tumors. Our goal is to shed light on the specific cells and mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment that play a role in inducing therapy resistance in pediatric solid tumors. This research will focus on prominent pediatric cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumors. The primary goal of this multi-disciplinary Program is to establish a comprehensive Pediatric Solid Tumor Microenvironment (PSTME) Atlas that would lead to discovering basic mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to modern therapies, and uncovering tumor microenvironment (TME) targetable vulnerabilities driven by resistance. The motivation for creating the PSTME atlas is the urgent need to improve survival of patients with high-risk subtypes of the proposed cancers, and to decrease treatment- related morbidities. By delving into the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment and its impact on treatment response, we aim to advance our understanding of pediatric solid tumors and pave the way for more effective therapeutic strategies. The Project will be supported by collaboration among two institutions with distinct and unique resources and technologies, and complementary expertise: A) Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) group will provide well annotated tumor specimens with clinical information in an ethnically diverse patient population, and lead in generating spatial proteomics data using pediatric and TME specific antibody panels. B) California Institute of Technology (Caltech) group will provide innovative spatial omics technologies including spatial transcriptomics and copy number, and novel data science approaches for integrative analysis of the generated data. The samples will be selected to represent solid tumor diversity based on established clinical risk stratifications, and critical points of transition (post chemotherapy response, relapse) to ensure capture of the diversity of PSTME. The PSTME atlas will impact the community through generation of easily accessible TME atlas providing a user friendly, searchable database of multiomics spatial analyses of common extracranial solid tumors with clinical and outcome data. It will also provide novel computational pipelines for integration and analysis of spatial data. These opensource tools will be made available to the community. In summary, the significance of the proposed project is the establishment of an atlas that will allow discovery of fundamental mechanisms of extrinsic cancer therapy resistance with the goal of leading to substantively improved probability of cure coupled with reduced therapy-related morbidity for children afflicted with solid tumors."
