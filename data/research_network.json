The Boston Human Tumor Atlas Network Research Center includes research institutions in Boston, Stanford, and Princeton that are mapping the cell types in breast cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer. The resulting tumor atlases will generate spatial and single-cell resolution information to provide an unprecedented understanding of the malignant, immune, and stromal cellular and tissue compartments that drive intrinsic and acquired resistance to existing and emerging therapeutics. These compartments then can be used to inform patient stratification and new treatment strategies and to make precision cancer medicine a reality. This detailed information is essential for the targeted therapies (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibition) and immunotherapies (e.g., anti-PD-1 therapies) we are examining, because these therapies typically benefit only a subset of patients treated with them for a limited period of time, and mechanisms of resistance to them are thus far poorly understood. Our studies will help develop both new insights to identify patients at risk of resistance to their cancer therapies and new treatment strategies to overcome both de novo and acquired resistance, ultimately improving the outcome for patients with cancer.",

DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of screening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of mammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United States will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for disease management, which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile multi-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to better understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint.",
      "To do this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and quantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these studies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and progression. Specific aspects of the proposed atlas construction include: 1) several types of DCIS cohorts that will capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active surveillance; 2) analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and atlas building considerations based on 3) radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches; 4) characterization at multiple scales including whole-tumor, single-duct, and single-cell levels; 5) characterization of relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and microenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles; 6) incorporation of the breast cancer-intrinsic subtype paradigm into the analytic phase; and 7) layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization.

      "We are constructing a multi-dimensional atlas of pre-melanoma focused on understanding genetic and epigenetic events that transform melanocytes into invasive tumors. Melanoma is a cancer of increasing prevalence that is curable with minor surgery if detected early but life-threatening when it metastasizes. Melanomas metastasize when still small, making early detection essential but challenging. Our atlas will delineate the precise sequence of events leading up to pre-melanoma through detailed spatial analysis of cell-autonomous events such as oncogene mutation and non-autonomous events such as escape from immune surveillance. The atlas is based on highly-multiplexed tissue imaging and single cell sequencing and focused on samples in which the full sequence of events from atypia to invasive melanoma can be visualized in a single specimen. The atlas will serve as a publicly accessible resource for research scientists, physicians, and patients and improve our ability to (i) highlight lesions likely to progress to cancer, (ii) identify high-risk patients to inform decisions on surgery, (iii) identify low-risk patients to reduce unnecessary procedures, (iv) design improved procedures for routine screening of all individuals, and (v) inform treatment options when surgery is insufficient.

    "description": "Metastasis embodies the whole-organism pathophysiology of cancer. The spread of cancer cells beyond the primary tumor site is responsible for the majority of cancer deaths and is the most overt expression of cancer’s complex evolutionary dynamics. Intimately related to the intricate processes of development and immunity, the transition from locally invasive to metastatic cancer also poses a major scientific hurdle. Recent technological and computational advancements enable dynamic, multidimensional, multiplanar analysis of multiple tissues. We are applying these advances to clinical samples with the aim of generating a high-resolution spatiotemporal tissue atlas of the most lethal cancers in the United States: lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and metastases of the central nervous system. Our approach is to obtain high-quality human biospecimens from surgical resections, biopsy, or autopsy of primary and disseminated tumors. Samples are interrogated using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing as well as spatially informative multiplexed molecular profiling using protein and RNA in situ hybridization–based technologies. Integration, analysis, and presentation of these datasets will be undertaken with the goal of generating human tumor atlases of value to the entire cancer research community.",

    "description": "The overall goal of the HTAN OMS Atlas Center is to elucidate mechanisms by which metastatic breast cancers become resistant to current generation pathway- and immune checkpoint-targeted treatments. The OMS Atlas is motivated by the appreciation that these treatments are often effective in primary tumors but only transiently effective in the metastatic setting. Possible resistance mechanisms include tumor-intrinsic genomic instability and epigenomic plasticity, as well as events extrinsic to the cancer cells, including chemical and mechanical signals from the microenvironments, production of mechanical extracellular matrix barriers and/or changes in vasculature that reduce drug and/or immune cell access, nanoscale cancer cell-microenvironment interactions that reduce drug efficacy, and a plethora of immune resistance mechanisms, such as loss of HLA expression and antigen presentation, and immune exhaustion. These mechanisms likely vary between patients and within individual patients and change with time as tumors respond to therapeutic attack. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating resistance mechanisms in two specific current generation clinical trial scenarios: (a) hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy and (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.",

      "We have established a state-of-the-art PreCancer Altas (PCA) for colorectal cancer (CRC) using Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) as a model system. CRC is one of the leading causes of death in the United States with 140,000 new cases arising each year. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are thought to be one of the early events in sporadic colorectal cancer. FAP families have inherited mutations in APC, and affected individuals classically develop hundreds of polyps, which often progress to invasive colon cancer by the third decade of life. Due to the extraordinarily high number of polyps that can be obtained from a single individual, FAP is an ideal disease system to study the host factors driving molecular heterogeneity in precancerous lesions. We expect these studies to inform diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic measures for sporadic CRC. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the early events that lead to and drive CRC, we will construct a PreCancer Atlas of the pre-cancerous polyps, early adenocarcinoma, and nearby normal tissue isolated from FAP patients. To build this atlas and execute this project, we have assembled an expert team of investigators with extensive experience working in large consortia. Together, we have already developed pipelines for multi-omics and imaging characterization, biospecimen collection, and analysis that we have leveraged for FAP samples."

The collaboration between the three components of the PCA research center has already generated preliminary data in several glioma samples. We will expand this effort to generate a comparative atlas of gliomas with distinct progression outcomes using integrated spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and chromosome profiling. By comparing the low-grade gliomas that eventually transform with ones that stay indolent or do not recur, and with IDH-mutant high-grade gliomas, we aim to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms at the low-grade stage that are predictive of malignant transformation (MT) and to suggest intervention strategies to prevent MT. The comparative analysis will examine three types of changes in low-grade gliomas with different outcomes: cell type composition, tumor microenvironment, and pathway specific gene expression. From UCLA’s Brain Tumor Translation Resource (BTTR) center, we have already collected 99 fresh-frozen low-grade glioma samples and will collect approximately an additional 100 samples of low-grade glioma with different outcomes (MT, indolent, and no- recurrence). 38% of the current cohort of patients are from under-represented minority groups; we will continue to recruit from a diverse patient pool in order to better understand which patients may be at higher risk for malignant transformation and therefore need more frequent surveillance or earlier intervention. We will then generate an integrated multi-modal spatial atlas targeting 2500 mRNAs, 10 proteins and 10 DNA CNVs and translocations. From the high sensitivity and multiplexed RNA seqFISH assays, we will be able to capture not only cell type and microenvironment information, but also genes and pathways that could be causal for progression to malignancy. Lastly, we will use the data to 1) predict tumor progression based on the cell type compositions and microenvironments; 2) design intervention strategies based on the spatial data, using counterfactual inference models to affect immune infiltrating and other predictors of progression; and 3) build a model of tumor progression dynamics based on gene expression and mechanics of the tissue. Our comprehensive low-grade glioma tissue collection, the integrated spatial dataset with transcriptomics, proteomics and chromosomal abnormalities, and the models built using advanced machine-learning tools will extend the existing capabilities of the HTAN consortium and be interoperable. The atlas and the computational tools will be used by us and the wider scientific community to further understand the mechanisms leading to malignant transformation.",

Patients with such mutations carry an elevated lifetime risk of advanced diffuse gastric cancer up to 80%. Prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is often advised but may not be necessary for all CDH1 mutation carriers. PTG is a\n\nmajor procedure associated with chronic physical and psychosocial disabilities, yet prior attempts to risk stratify patients based on specific variants or family cancer history have not been successful and tools to identify patients at high risk are currently lacking. This is largely due to our limited understanding of the earliest events that drive T1a lesion development and progression. GAME3D integrates cutting-edge multimodal, single-cell, and 3D spatial technologies to construct a comprehensive atlas of the N-T1a-AGC continuum. Through longitudinal samples, the Center will: (1) create a dynamic 2D spatial atlas; (2) build a 3D spatiotemporal atlas at single-cell resolution; and (3) develop computational models of tumor initiation and progression. This work will uncover key mechanisms driving AGC development, offering new targets for early interception.",

    "description": "The majority of solid tumors in children have a unique origin compared to those in adults, stemming from their rise from embryonic cells. Despite this distinction, there is still limited understanding of the differences in the microenvironments of these pediatric tumors compared to adult cancers, and how these differences might contribute to lineage plasticity and treatment resistance. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive investigation into the spatial biology of these tumors. Our goal is to shed light on the specific cells and mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment that play a role in inducing therapy resistance in pediatric solid tumors. This research will focus on prominent pediatric cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumors. The primary goal of this multi-disciplinary Program is to establish a comprehensive Pediatric Solid Tumor Microenvironment (PSTME) Atlas that would lead to discovering basic mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to modern therapies, and uncovering tumor microenvironment (TME) targetable vulnerabilities driven by resistance. The motivation for creating the PSTME atlas is the urgent need to improve survival of patients with high-risk subtypes of the proposed cancers, and to decrease treatment- related morbidities. By delving into the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment and its impact on treatment response, we aim to advance our understanding of pediatric solid tumors and pave the way for more effective therapeutic strategies. The Project will be supported by collaboration among two institutions with distinct and unique resources and technologies, and complementary expertise: A) Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) group will provide well annotated tumor specimens with clinical information in an ethnically diverse patient population, and lead in generating spatial proteomics data using pediatric and TME specific antibody panels. B) California Institute of Technology (Caltech) group will provide innovative spatial omics technologies including spatial transcriptomics and copy number, and novel data science approaches for integrative analysis of the generated data. The samples will be selected to represent solid tumor diversity based on established clinical risk stratifications, and critical points of transition (post chemotherapy response, relapse) to ensure capture of the diversity of PSTME. The PSTME atlas will impact the community through generation of easily accessible TME atlas providing a user friendly, searchable database of multiomics spatial analyses of common extracranial solid tumors with clinical and outcome data. It will also provide novel computational pipelines for integration and analysis of spatial data. These opensource tools will be made available to the community. In summary, the significance of the proposed project is the establishment of an atlas that will allow discovery of fundamental mechanisms of extrinsic cancer therapy resistance with the goal of leading to substantively improved probability of cure coupled with reduced therapy-related morbidity for children afflicted with solid tumors.",
